Scenario:
 Combine lists of current and past employees.
Task:

 UNION removes duplicates, UNION ALL keeps all rows.
 


Day 33: Functions
SQL Question 1: String Functions
Scenario:
 Clean up employee names for reporting.
Task:
 Write queries using UPPER, LOWER, SUBSTRING, CONCAT.
Expected Output:
 Formatted name outputs are displayed.
 
SQL Question 2: Date Functions
Scenario:
 Calculate employee tenure in years.
Task:
 Use DATE functions like YEAR(), DATEDIFF(), NOW().
Expected Output:
